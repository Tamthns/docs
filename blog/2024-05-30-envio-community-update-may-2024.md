## Python Package for Envio‚Äôs HyperFuel Client is live! üêç

Now developers and analysts building on the [Fuel Network](https://fuel.network/) can interact with our flexible [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/overview-hypersync) API using either [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) clients, and choose to query their data in JSON, Arrow, and Parquet data formats.

To install, run the $ pip install hyperfuel command.

Learn more [here](https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-client-python).

See the simple Python script example below:

```python
# This example will simply fetch the logs from the given contracts over a block range

# returns all log data necessary for fuel's decoder

import hyperfuel
import asyncio

async def main():
client = hyperfuel.HyperfuelClient()

contracts = ["0xff63ad3cdb5fde197dfa2d248330d458bffe631bda65938aa7ab7e37efa561d0"]
from_block = 8076516
to_block = 8076517

logs = await client.preset_query_get_logs(contracts, from_block, to_block)

print("number of logs: " + str(len(logs.data)))
print("logs: " + str(logs.data))

asyncio.run(main())
```
